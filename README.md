# 1.Intro #

-The idea of this project was to play around with some decorative graphics;  
-A good step for decorative graphics or relaxing is to draw ellipses with this app.
***

# 2.Description #

-Here you will use the mouse cursor, just hover the screen (up-left for small ellipse, down-left for long ellipse, up-right for large ellipse, and down-right for big ellipse, both long and large...);   
-The color of the stroke will change randomly, so I think is good for the purpose of this app to make some great graphics...   
***

# 3.Conclusion #

-This app is designed to be used as an Android app (see inside the setup function, the fullScreen(P2D) function used more for Android...), but you can use at the same functionality performance as a Desktop app;   
-I think it is a fancy app, with a straight purpose, to make some great graphics, for fun, for relaxing, or to make a desktop wallpaper (who knows?!).
